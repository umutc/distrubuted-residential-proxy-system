      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of an end-to-end synchronous flow into detailed technical subtasks, focusing on API modifications, notification mechanisms, timeout handling, error propagation, response formatting, logging, and performance optimization. Include specific technical approaches for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves connecting multiple components and implementing several mechanisms (notification, timeout, error handling) across the system. It requires deep understanding of the existing architecture and careful coordination between components. The complexity comes from ensuring reliable synchronous communication in what might have been an asynchronous system originally."

      "taskTitle": "Implement agent monitoring endpoint",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create detailed subtasks for implementing an agent monitoring API endpoint, including specific AWS service configurations, data retrieval mechanisms, response formatting, authentication methods, and logging implementation. For each subtask, specify the technical approach and potential challenges.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex as it involves creating a new API endpoint and associated backend logic. While it requires integration with existing systems to retrieve agent information, it's primarily an additive feature rather than modifying existing functionality. The authentication and data formatting add some complexity but are standard API development concerns."

      "taskTitle": "Implement comprehensive error handling and logging",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation of comprehensive error handling and logging across both Agent and Orchestrator components, including structured logging patterns, error categorization, reconnection strategies, retry mechanisms, health checks, graceful shutdown procedures, and monitoring metrics. For each subtask, specify implementation details and cross-component considerations.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to its cross-cutting nature affecting multiple components. It requires deep understanding of the system's failure modes and careful implementation of recovery mechanisms. The task touches on multiple advanced reliability concepts (structured logging, backoff strategies, health checks, graceful shutdown) and requires careful coordination to ensure consistent error handling across the system."
